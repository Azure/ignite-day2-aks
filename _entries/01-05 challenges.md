Useful resources are provided to help you work through each task. To ensure you progress at a good pace ensure workload is divided between team members where possible. This may mean anticipating work that might be required in a later task.

> **Hint**: If you get stuck, you can ask for help from the proctors. You may also choose to peek at the solutions.

### Core tasks

You are expected to at least complete the **Getting up and running** section. This involves setting up a Kubernetes cluster, deploying the application containers from Docker Hub, setting up monitoring and scaling your application.

### DevOps tasks

Once you're done with the above, next would be to include some DevOps. **Complete as many tasks as you can**. You'll be setting up a Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery pipeline for your application and then using Helm to deploy it.

### Advanced cluster tasks

If you're up to it, explore configuring the Azure Kubernetes Service cluster with Virtual Nodes, enabling MongoDB replication, using HashiCorp's Terraform to deploy AKS and your application and more.
