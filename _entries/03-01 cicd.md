Your development team are making an increasing number of modifications to your application code. It is no longer feasible to manually deploy updates.

You are required to create a robust DevOps pipeline supporting CI/CD to deploy code changes.

> **Hint** The source code repositories on GitHub contain an [`azure-pipelines.yml`](https://github.com/Azure/azch-captureorder/blob/master/azure-pipelines.yml) definition that you can use with Azure Pipelines to build and deploy the containers.

### Tasks

#### Fork the captureorder project on GitHub

{% collapsible %}

You'll need to work on your own copy of the code. Fork the project [https://github.com/Azure/azch-captureorder/](https://github.com/Azure/azch-captureorder/) on GitHub.

![Fork on GitHub](media/cicd2/01-fork_github.png)

{% endcollapsible %}

#### Update the manifest to point to your Azure Container Registry

{% collapsible %}

After you fork the project, make sure to update `manifests/deployment.yaml` to point to your Azure Container Registry.

![Update Azure Container Registry in manifest](media/cicd2/update-acr-deployment.png)

{% endcollapsible %}

#### Create an Azure DevOps account

{% collapsible %}

Go to <https://dev.azure.com> and sign-in with your Azure subscription credentials.

If this is your first time to provision an Azure DevOps account, you'll be taken through a quick wizard to create a new organization.

{% endcollapsible %}

#### Create a project on Azure DevOps

{% collapsible %}

Create a new private project, call it **captureorder**

![Create Azure DevOps project](media/cicd2/03-create_project.png)

{% endcollapsible %}

#### Enable the new multistage pipeline and new service connection (Preview)

This pipeline is based on the [new multi-stage pipelines](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/devops/whats-new-with-azure-pipelines/) feature of Azure DevOps Pipelines which is still in preview. Make sure to enable it on your Azure Pipelines account.

{% collapsible %}

Click on your profile icon (top-left), then click on **Preview features**.

![Preview features](media/cicd2/preview-features.png)

Enable the multistage pipelines and new service connection experiences.

![Enable multistage pipelines](media/cicd2/00-multistage-pipeline-preview.png)

{% endcollapsible %}

#### Create Docker service connection

Now that you have a project, you need to set it up to authenticate to your Azure Container Registry through a [service connection](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/library/service-endpoints?view=azure-devops&tabs=yaml#create-new).

{% collapsible %}

Go to your project settings page.

![Project settings](media/cicd2/04.1-project_settings.png)

Open the service connections page from the project settings page and create a new service connection.

![Create a service connection](media/cicd2/04.2-create_service_connection.png)

Add a Docker Registry service connection. Select **Azure Container Registry** and pick your ACR from the list. Name the connection `containerRegistryConnection`.

![Create a service connection](media/cicd2/04.3-create_acr_connection.png)

{% endcollapsible %}

#### Create a variable group to hold configuration

Now, instead of hard coding some configuration values and secrets into the pipeline or Kubernetes YAML configuration, you're going to use [variable group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/library/variable-groups?view=azure-devops&tabs=yaml) to hold this information.

{% collapsible %}

Go to **Pipelines -> Library** and create a new variable group.

![Create variable group](media/cicd2/06-create_variable_group.png)

Name the group `captureorder-variables` and create a `mongoPassword` secret holding your MongoDB password. Make sure to click on the lock icon to designate this a a secret.

![Create mongoPassword](media/cicd2/06.1-create_mongo_password.png)

Afterwards, also add the rest of the variables `mongoHost` and `mongoUser`.

![Create rest of variables](media/cicd2/06.2-create_rest_of_variables.png)

Save and proceed.

{% endcollapsible %}

#### Create an Environment

[Environments](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/process/environments?view=azure-devops) are a new concept in Azure DevOps Pipelines. An environment represents a collection of resources such as namespaces within Kubernetes clusters, Azure Web Apps, virtual machines, databases, which can be targeted by deployments from a pipeline. Typical examples of environments include Dev, Test, QA, Staging and Production.

Currently, only Kubernetes resource type is supported, with the roadmap of environments including support for other resources such as virtual machines, databases and more.

{% collapsible %}

Create your first environment

![Create an environment](media/cicd2/05-create_environment.png)

Create a Kubernetes environment called `aksworkshop`. This will create a Service Principal on your AKS cluster and store it in the service connections.

![Create an aksworkshop environment](media/cicd2/05.1-create_k8s_environment.png)

Select your AKS cluster, and create a new namespace called `dev`

![Create a dev namespace](media/cicd2/05.2-create_namespace.png)

{% endcollapsible %}

#### Create a pipeline

{% collapsible %}

Go back to pipelines and create a new pipeline.

![Create a pipeline](media/cicd2/07-create_pipeline.png)

 Walk through the steps of the wizard by first selecting **GitHub** as the location of your source code.

![Where is your code?](media/cicd2/07-where_is_your_code.png)

You might be redirected to GitHub to sign in. If so, enter your GitHub credentials. When the list of repositories appears, select your repository.

![Select repository](media/cicd2/08-select_repository.png)

You might be redirected to GitHub to install the Azure Pipelines app. If so, select Approve and install.

![Install GitHub app](media/cicd2/09-install_github_app.png)

The source code repository already contains a multi-stage pipeline, which is picked up by the configuration. Inspect the [`azure-pipelines.yml`](https://github.com/Azure/azch-captureorder/blob/master/azure-pipelines.yml) file for the full pipeline. We're relying on a new feature in Azure DevOps which is called "Multi-stage pipelines". [Make sure the Multi-stage pipelines experience is turned on](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/project/navigation/preview-features?view=azure-devops_).

![Review pipeline](media/cicd2/10-review_pipeline.png)

The pipeline is broken into two main [stages](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/process/stages?view=azure-devops&tabs=yaml):

1. Build
1. Deploy

Each stage then has one or more [jobs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/process/phases?view=azure-devops&tabs=yaml), which in turn have one or more [tasks](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/process/tasks?view=azure-devops&tabs=yaml). A task is the building block for defining automation in a pipeline. A task is simply a packaged script or procedure that has been abstracted with a set of inputs.

##### Inspect the variables

There are a couple of variables that are referenced in the pipeline.

- `captureorder-variables` is the name of the [variable group you created earlier](#create-a-variable-group-to-hold-configuration).
- `dockerRegistryServiceConnection` refers to the [Service Connection you created earlier to Azure Container Registry](#create-docker-service-connection).
- `acrEndpoint` refers to where the image is deployed, for example `acr73505.azurecr.io`. You need to change this to your environment details.
- `tag` refers to the auto-generated build ID. This is used to tag the container images built and deployed.

```yaml
variables:
  - group: captureorder-variables # Variable Group containing 'mongoHost', 'mongoUser' and the secret 'mongoPassword'

  - name: dockerRegistryServiceConnection
    value: 'containerRegistryConnection' # make sure it matches the name you used in the service connection
  
  - name: acrEndpoint
    value: 'uniqueacrname.azurecr.io' # replace with container registry endpoint

  - name: tag
    value: '$(Build.BuildId)' # computed at build time
```

> **Important** Make sure to change the value of the `acrEndpoint` variable from `uniqueacrname.azurecr.io` to your Azure Container Registry details, for example `acr73505.azurecr.io`.

##### Inspect the Build stage

The **Build** stage does two things, it uses the [Docker task](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/build/docker?view=azure-devops) to build an image. It authenticates using the Docker service connection and tags the image with the build number.

```yaml
- task: Docker@2
  displayName: Build and push an image to container registry
  inputs:
    command: buildAndPush
    repository: $(imageRepository)
    dockerfile: '**/Dockerfile'
    containerRegistry: $(dockerRegistryServiceConnection)
    tags: $(tag)
```

It then publishes the [`manifests`](https://github.com/Azure/azch-captureorder/tree/master/manifests) folder, containing the Kubernetes YAML definitions as a pipeline artifact. This is used later in the deployment stage to deploy to Kubernetes.

```yaml
- task: PublishPipelineArtifact@0
  inputs:
    artifactName: 'manifests'
    targetPath: 'manifests'
```

> **Hint**
> - Inspect the YAML files in the **manifests** folder and make sure to replace with your own deployment files.
> - Following best practices, [`deployment.yaml`](https://github.com/Azure/azch-captureorder/blob/master/manifests/deployment.yaml) loads the MongoDB hostname, username and password from a [Kubernetes secret](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/). Make sure to modify your configuration files to follow the same mechanism.

##### Inspect the Deploy stage and edit the `imageRepository` variable

The **Deploy** stage does multiple things. First, it downloads the pipeline artifacts (the manifest folder).

```yaml
- task: DownloadPipelineArtifact@1
  inputs:
    artifactName: 'manifests'
    downloadPath: '$(System.ArtifactsDirectory)/manifests'
```

Then, using the [Kubernetes manifest task](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/deploy/kubernetes-manifest?view=azure-devops) `createSecret` action, it creates a Kubernetes secret holding the MongoDB host, username and password. Note that the `secretArguments` follows the same syntax as when [creating a secret using `kubectl`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/inject-data-application/distribute-credentials-secure/#define-a-container-environment-variable-with-data-from-a-single-secret). The values are coming from the variable group you created before.

```yaml
- task: KubernetesManifest@0
  displayName: Create secret for MongoDB
  inputs:
    action: createSecret
    secretName: mongodb
    secretType: generic
    namespace: $(k8sNamespace)
    secretArguments: --from-literal=mongoHost=$(mongoHost) --from-literal=mongoUser=$(mongoUser) --from-literal=mongoPassword=$(mongoPassword)
```

The next task then deploys all the YAML files in the `manifests` folder. It automatically overrides the image name you defined in the `deployment.yaml` file to append the current build ID as a tag to the image.

> **Note** For this to work, you should make sure to change the value of the `acrEndpoint` in the pipeline to match your `deployment.yaml` file. For example: `uniqueacrname.azurecr.io`.

```yaml
- task: KubernetesManifest@0
  displayName: Deploy to Kubernetes cluster
  inputs:
    action: deploy
    namespace: $(k8sNamespace)
    manifests: $(System.ArtifactsDirectory)/manifests/*
    containers: '$(acrEndpoint)/captureorder:$(tag)'
```

{% endcollapsible %}

#### Run your pipeline

To save your pipeline, click on **Run**. You will be able to view the status of the pipeline execution.

{% collapsible %}

![Run the pipeline](media/cicd2/11-run_pipeline.png)

The build stage will build the container and push it to Azure Container Registry.

![Build stage](media/cicd2/11.1-build_stage.png)

The deploy stage will create the secrets and deploy the manifests to the `dev` namespace of your AKS cluster.

![Build stage](media/cicd2/11.2-deploy_stage.png)

> **Troubleshooting:** If your deployment times out, you can inspect what's going on by doing a `kubectl get pods --namespace dev` and `kubectl get events --namespace dev`. If you get an `ImagePullBackOff`, this probably means you missed updating the repository with your own Azure Container Registry in `manifests/deployment.yaml`. Make sure to update this in your code fork.
